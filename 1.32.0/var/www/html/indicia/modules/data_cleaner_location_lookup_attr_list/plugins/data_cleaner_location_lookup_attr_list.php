/**
 * Hook into the data cleaner to declare checks for the test of a location attribute lookup being in or out of a list of provided preferred terms.
 * This assumes the location is linked to the sample by the location_id when it identifies the records to flag up.
 * Rule reversal is supported. If not reversed then values not in the list cause the record to be flagged. If reversed then items in the list
 * cause the record to be flagged.
 * Requires 
 * - verification checks enabled for the website
 * - data for Terms (list of values). Will be compared to the preferred term from the lookup.
 * - metadata for JoinMethod - either meaning_id or termlists_term_id to join to the term via the meaning_id or the termlists_term_id. Default
 *     is termlists_term_id as meaning_id is only used in some special case multi-lingual surveys to simplify localisation of terms. 
 * - metadata for Attr (pointing to attribute ID, attribute must be lookup).
 * - metadata for SurveyId
 * @return type array of rules.
