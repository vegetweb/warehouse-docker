<p>Verification rules can be created by uploading files that are compatible with the NBN Record Cleaner. 
For more information on creating these files, see 
<a href="http://www.nbn.org.uk/Tools-Resources/Recording-Resources/NBN-Record-Cleaner/Creating-verification-rules.aspx">
NBN Record Cleaner - creating verification rules</a>. You can either use the online file servers
as used by NBN Record Cleaner to obtain rules or zip your files into a batch to upload. Alternatively you can create
a CSV file containing one column per property in a rule file and one row per rule to upload. Column titles
must exactly match the name of the section, followed by a colon, then the name of the attribute, e.g.
a column Data:StartDate contains the start date for a PeriodWithinYear check. The CSV file should therefore 
contain a column called Metadata:TestType containing the rule name e.g. Period or PeriodWithinYear. Finally
the CSV file should contain a RuleID column containing a unique reference for every row for the rule being created,
allowing future file uploads to replace existing rules if they have the same rule ID.</p>
