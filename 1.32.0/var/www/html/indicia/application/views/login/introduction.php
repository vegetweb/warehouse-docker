<p>Indicia is a toolkit that simplifies the construction of new websites which allow data entry, mapping and reporting
  of wildlife records. Indicia is an Open Source project managed by the <a href="http://www.brc.ac.uk/">Biological
    Records Centre</a>, within the <a href="http://www.ceh.ac.uk/">NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology<a/>.</p>

  built using Indicia. In order to gain access to this warehouse you must log on. If you
  do not have an account and need one, please contact the administrator <?php echo $admin_contact; ?>
