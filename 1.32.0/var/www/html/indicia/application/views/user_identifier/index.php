<p>Provide a list of known identifiers used by this user on other systems. When identifiers are
from systems which can be used during the login process on a client website (e.g. Twitter, Facebook
or OpenID), identifiers can be used to ensure that even when logged in on multiple websites, a 
single recorder is recognised as such.</p>
