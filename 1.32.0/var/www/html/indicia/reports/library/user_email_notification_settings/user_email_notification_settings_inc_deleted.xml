    title="User Email Notification Settings List Including Deleted Items."
    description="Example Use - List includes deleted items as the system needs to know when a user has never had any items so that it makes the default
        records for a user when they login. If they have deleted records it means they have some items previously but have deliberately removed their
        own settings, so we wouldn't want to automatically create some more in that situation. (The reason why the defaults are not just created
        when the user is created, is their warehouse user id which is needed is only created when they first login to Drupal)"
